Kei Kebreau, Ph.D. student in computer science, City University of New York

I am a Ph.D. student and NSF CSGrad4US Fellow in the Visualization and Virtual Reality Lab led by Dr. Wole Oyekoya. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a software quality engineer at Mastercard. I also conducted research as an undergraduate research assistant at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania. Outside of work, I enjoy playing games, writing music, and reading.
